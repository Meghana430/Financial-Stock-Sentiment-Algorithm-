      "Mark Kelley, an analyst from Stifel Nicolaus, maintained the Hold rating on Ebay (EBAY – Research Report). The associated price target is $45.00.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark Kelley has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors regarding Ebay’s recent performance and future prospects. The main factor is the mixed results from Ebay’s 3Q23, which showed some positive growth areas such as the focus category growth and the advertising business. However, these bright spots were somewhat offset by weakening consumer trends that started in September and continue to the present. This has led to expectations for a muted holiday season, particularly due to weakness in consumer demand from the EU, specifically the UK and Germany, and to a lesser extent, the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second set of factors contributing to the Hold rating are the challenges facing eBay in the near term. Although the growth in focus categories is encouraging, Mark is cautious about its potential to be a major growth catalyst, especially considering the increasingly challenging macro environment and weaker discretionary spending trends. The report also indicated that the operating income was below consensus and the company has had to marginally lower its estimates and TP. Therefore, despite certain positive aspects, the combination of weak consumer demand, challenging macroeconomic conditions, and mixed financial results has led to Mark Kelley’s decision to rate eBay’s stock as Hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another report released today, TD Cowen also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $42.00 price target.\n",
