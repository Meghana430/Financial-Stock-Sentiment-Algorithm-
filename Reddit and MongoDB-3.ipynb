The ticker symbol is $NEGG and it is currently trading at a 3.91 billion dollar market cap. As many PC gamers know, Newegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years. Additionally they have also been expanding into selling in other areas such as VR, gaming consoles, digital games, and Auto parts.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    They are currently trading at 1.5x sales and not too much information is publicly available about the stock which is why you probably haven’t heard of it. I have reason to believe that they will benefit from the increased demand of computer parts in the years to follow. The prices are competitive to Amazon and often times they have a wider selection of available things to buy from the site. I expect that they will also utilize the IPO proceeds to invest in improving their company/ spreading their reach as they are now a publicly traded company.\n",

      "Date: Tuesday, February 02, 2021\n",
      "Content: By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Here’s some DD for anybody who doesn’t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That’s just a given.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I’m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn’t why I’m going fucking hard in the calls. Here’s the real cherry on top:\n",
      "  \n",
      "    eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it’s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn’t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it’s time we do the same.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pokémon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It’s 2021.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I’ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk.\n",

      "Title: The Affirm IPO and A New Way to Rip People Off : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Tuesday, December 08, 2020\n",
      "Content: So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of \"offers\" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.\n",
      "  \n",
      "TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and \"buy now, pay later\" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year\n",
      "\n",
      "    For the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Starting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has estimated revenue of ~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in former PayPal executive Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle advertises its business product as \"Engaging the next generation\" and the ability to \"unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk\".\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Next is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They reported their year ending June 30 and revenue topped $11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants. There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    This company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. VP Xin Ge 7 years at paypal, Dana Stalder VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, Amanda Pires 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks\n",
      "  \n",
      "    At this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is Max Levchin who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's partnership with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the investors in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential. Affirm is going to IPO and its rocket both short term and long term\n",

      "    IMO Afterpay is the stronger BNPL company, but Affirm has a slightly different business model with its repayment structure (Afterpay do 4 fortnightly repayments, while Affirm has longer loans and optional interest fees with a credit-rating system - this also means you can improve your credit rating with Affirm).\n",
      "   \n",
      "     \n",
      "   \n",
      "    Some of Affirm's strengths are that it has some strong partnerships with Shopify (A huge chunk of online stores) and Adyen (A payment platform), and its acquisition of PayBright a few days ago makes it the dominant player in Canada. Their team has also been quite effective at snatching up some prized high revenue websites like Peleton, Walmart, StockX, Dyson, DJI, etc.) Also, Klarna and Afterpay are basically identical, so ideally they'd cannibalise each other in the USA market while Affirm carves out a unique niche (Usually in higher-ticket items which make the longer repayment plans more logical). Affirm also has unique software to judge the credit worthiness of consumers (Beyond credit rating) and it's actually pretty effective, with a roughly 1% delinquency rate. This is better than Afterpay and Klarna and will likely make Affirm more resilient in downturns.\n",
      "   \n",
      "     \n",
      "   \n",
      "    The risks of Affirm are that:\n",
      "   \n",
      "    Nearly 30% of revenue comes from Peleton alone (Although I expect this to come down in the future as stay-at-home stuff winds down)\n",
      "   \n",
      "    Short-term risk with a rotation out of tech and lockdown-winners\n",
      "   \n",
      "    A potentially inflated IPO would make it slightly unappealing compared to the lead player, Afterpay (~$20b)\n",
      "   \n",
      "    While I'd normally be hugely bullish about a Paypal mafia CEO, Affirm has basically been asleep at the wheel and had their number 1 spot in the US market snatched out of their hands in the past few years by Afterpay.\n",
      "   \n",
      "    This is just an anecdotal thing, but Affirm's payment platform looks more confusing and intimidating than Afterpay's, and so when both of these are offered on the same page (e.g. Adidas), I'd wager most millenials/Gen Z would opt for Afterpay.\n",
      "   \n",
      "    Afterpay basically has a stranglehold on Australia/NZ, and Klarna for Europe, so I don't see much growth for Affirm beyond the North American space. (Luckily NA is the most important one anyway so it doesn't worry me too much)\n",
      "   \n",
      "     \n",
      "   \n",
      "    Anyway, take this with a grain of salt. I'm a massive Afterpay bull so I might be a bit biased. My plan is to cash out a bit under half my Afterpay and go with Affirm since IMO Affirm is carving out a strong niche and has great partnerships. They both have great long-term potential, but there's probably a chance to capitalise on short-term hype with Affirm right now.\n",
      "   \n",
      "     \n",
      "   \n",
      "Edit: Affirm delayed IPO. Be careful in purchasing at IPO if they jack up the price a lot - if the marketcap exceeds Afterpay, then it isn't worth it IMO.\n",

      "Content: I've been a seller on $ebay for many many years. It's my only income outside of rental properties.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    EBay did an update in April that seems to have broken their search result algorithm. I've seen hundreds of seller complaining about a significant drop in sales since the update. Personally, mine are down 80%.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    It's not the reopening or a broader economy issue. My etsy sales are pretty much flat during the same time period.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    After doing some more digging, I found that many of my listings are just not showing up in search results. Many other sellers are reporting the same.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    What ever eBay did with their \"update\" has made it so that even if you're a Top Rated seller offering same day handling with free shipping and you're also paying eBay to promote your listings...they just don't show up.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    So, some of this will likely mean that they are just buying from other eBay sellers. But those sellers are more expensive, so the buyer may check Amazon. But this also isn't just one category, so there are likely items that only have a few people offering them...if they aren't showing up then those buyers are going elsewhere.\n",

I wouldn't be honest if I didn't say that I'm hoping a drop in share price gets the CEOs attention. I had to cut all my employees hours by 90% since this happened and shut down my recent attempt to open a brick and mortar as part of the reopening. The online sales were the only way I could afford a sustained loss to try this. So we got out of our lease early and moved to a little warehouse until this passes.\n",

      "Title: Ebay undervalued : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Sunday, September 19, 2021\n",
      "Content: Ebay is a e commerce website that allows people to find just about anything they are looking for on their global marketplace aka ebay.com . Their platform helps connect millions of buyers and seller all over the world on a daily biases.\n",
      "  \n",
      "WSB TLDR- Its basically like amazon,etsy,etc\n",
      "\n",
      "    So whats up with them?\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Well, they are undervalued . They have been beating earnings for the last few quarters and are in a very competitive field that will not go away any time soon.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    E commerce showed just how big it was thanks to covid. A lot of companies revamped their e commerce portion such as how walmart target and bunch of retail companies allowing people to have curb side pick up ( they come to the parking lot and a store associate goes and drops off their groceries . Doordash and other food delivery services helping save a lot of businesses by allowing people to buy and get food when restaurants couldn't have people come and sit and eat. Etc.. And the biggest example... fucking amazon , the king itself , has crushed earnings with 3 quarters striking over 100 billion dollars in revenue . This e commerce wave was already coming , but covid helped speed it up .\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Furthermore since 2020 .. well earlier but ima start from 2020 they started selling off parts of their business to the other companies that specialize in that certain niche. For instance\n",
      "  \n",
      "    \" eBay in November agreed to sell its ticketing unit, StubHub, for $4.05 billion to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd. \"(cnbc) This is old.\n",
      "\n",
      "    They also sold ebay korea to this huge korean retail gaint that says this will help improve their e commerce portion , while ebay still holds 20% stake.\n",
      "  \n",
      "TLDR- Ebay is selling off parts of its company that isnt bringing in enough revenue to A cut costs , B gain cash/ value in the long run because they still hold a stake , C making themselves more competitive by focusing on their main revenue streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "    SUPER IMPORTANT-\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Furthermore, Ebay made it official that they will be dropping Paypal effectively allowing Ebay to manage the transactions themselves which means more money for ebay . They will do this by using Adyen, a payments which already has deals with netflix uber and a few other big tech compaines, thus effectively meaning more money for ebay since they are cutting out the middle man.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Ebay these last 4 quarters has been crushing earnings with beat after beat on revenue and eps with the last quarter bringing in 2.67billion vs the expected 2.63 and an eps of .99 vs .96 .\n",
      "  \n",
      "    BIG CATALYST\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Guess what, its that time of the year again when ebay will perform amazing the fall holiday season is already here with retail stores already getting the candy and shitty spooky theme . Ebay has always performed amazing every time around this time of the year.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I see right now as the time to buy since it isnt priced in yet... here let me say it like this .\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Homedepot, lowes and a bunch of other compaines started gaining a lot of value from may , june, july leading up and into hurricane season . Thus when the hurricane came IT WAS ALREADY PRICED IN. Furthermore , most stocks last week including ebay tested out a support line.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Right now , ebay is trading at around 74 bucks which in undervalued\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Here price targets are calculated-\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Price target = (Stock price / Foward pe )x Current PE\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The current pe is the trailing pe\n",
      "  \n",
      "    stock price - it closed last friday at 74.11\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Forward pe is 17.3\n",
      "  \n",
      "    current is 22.59\n",
      "  \n",
      "    the pt is about 96.7 as of now for the end of the year\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Now granted other factors do matter this the price target gets changed around such as how supply chains have effected the market, covid, competitors but so far ebay has been managing itself and is slowly growing each and every year.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    TLDR- Ebay is undervalued asf , its been crushing earnings each quarter, and is about to run up due to the holiday season coming\n",

      "    I didn’t realize how good selling was on eBay until I started posting shit… I started posting all kinds of random items and I fill the orders, get paid. I’m like that’s it? Have an inventory to sell. Buy low and sell high? Make money? I member the days when it was an auction only site. But I think it is better known for selling collectibles and small niche items. They have high fees so I see why they are profiting.\n",

For private users it's imo still the best marketplace to sell stuff at: its save, payment is processed by eBay, if the seller tries to finesse you you get your money back. And even for commercial sellers its great because fees are way lower than on Amazon and you aren't taken from behind by Amazon's product stealing and generous return policies that basically allow customers to refund and return absolutely destroyed wares.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Recently the market has been risk-off, where capital has been funneled into boring stable companies + bonds, and away from anything related to growth. There are reasons for this; future interest rate hikes and selling of bonds from the federal reserve, inflation, supply chain shocks, yield curve flattening, mounting recession risks, and the ongoing war in Ukraine causing commodity price imbalances.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The main cause is the federal reserve hiking interest rates and will be selling bonds. What this does is decrease the money supply which increases bond yields and interest rates. This makes future money LESS valuable using Discounted Cash Flow model (DCF)\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The DCF basically says that the value of future money is directly impacted by interest rates, and as interest rates increase, the value of future cash flow decreases relative to the value today.\n",

      "    The Yield Curve is a forward looking indicator of the economy. It tracks the spread between the 10 yr and 2 yr treasury. What an inverted yield curve means is that investors are more pessimistic about the economy in the long run than in the short run. Inverted yield curves have pre-dated recessions every single time.

      "  \n",
      "    I personally love Paypal’s products and use them on an almost daily basis. Paypal has shown that it can seamlessly integrate itself with businesses, and, as the world continues to digitalize, it is bound to share in that growth.\n",

Over the course of 4 years I watched as more and more talented engineers were allowed to walk while more AWF's (Alternative WorkForce) took over key portions of projects. Most recently, the stock tanking from 312 to 96 (now back to 102, sure) is hitting hard, with a lot of people holding onto their shares last year now unable to sell enough to cover their taxes. Talented people are leaving in droves and management has no appetite for fixing it, just dressing it up to look nice.\n",

      "Title: Just a little eBay DD (Repeat of FedEx?) : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Tuesday, July 07, 2020\n",
      "Content: To start I have been a seller on eBay since 2018 and just become a \"Top Seller\" last month (highest ranked seller on eBay).   I experienced many oddities that I never have seen/had on eBay and am confident this is the closest thing to Insider Info you are going to get.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Company Background Info:  eBay has been around since 1995 and used to be an auction site.  Over the last decade it has been transitioning into a large wholesale and warehouse style business similar to Amazon (only with auctions as an option for sellers).  eBay works very closely with Paypal and has been since 2002.  Together eBay collects an average of 10% and Paypal collects 2.5% of every sale sitewide.  At the start of this year eBay began rolling out a program similar to Paypal (or other online transactors) for sellers to test, so they have that going for them too.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Sales Spike: Back in March/April when everything locked down eBay was flooded with new buyers like I had never seen before.  During this a few of the days their was so much traffic the site couldn't handle it and crashed multiple times.  eBay has been lagging in online sales over the years because of competitors like Amazon and Shopify, but during the pandemic entire sectors were cleaned out of items similar to Amazon.  Many Top Sellers myself included had our inventories cleaned out as demand increased.  Random items selling like crazy especially after people started to get their Trump Bucks.  The last year and in Q1 2020 eBay GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) have been down between 6-9% (depending on where you look) so this earnings report percentage increase will be very dramatic for the company.  Since the start of April, GMV has grown more than 20% week over week (said by executives so probably around 5-10% which is still a lot for the site being down 9).\n",
      "  \n",
      "Sellers Getting Big Benefits to Sell: In case you didn't know on eBay you cannot just sell 1000 items in you store (not without paying a bunch of fees).  You start with 10 free listings and work your way up (many stores sit around the 100 or 200 free range).  During the lockdowns eBay allowed for anyone who had a store to sell 100,000 for April and May which is still going on as a 50,000 offer right now ending in August (but will probably extend to the fall).  They also set up a program for small mom and pop businesses and stores in specific categories to be featured on the home page of eBay daily to help them.  New eBay stores would not have to pay the monthly fee (we all pay to have store status, which varies based on what services you want starting at $4.95 a month) for three months and immediately had access to 500 listings.  They also deferred fees for certain stores (not mine unfortunately) for the month of April, and offered 100% seller protection on delayed shipping or fraudulent buyers.\n",
      "  \n",
      "FedEx/USPS: FedEx, Ups, and USPS were overrun in April to the point where they had temp job openings at one point.  This was due to the virus sending some of their staff home and the large flux of online sales.  One of the reasons eBay allowed sellers to ship late was because of these delays.  FedEx is a partner of eBay as well and the pair offer very generous discounts on shipping for eBay sellers, so I believe the surge in eBay sales may have helped FedEx's earnings (I certainly paid them a lot this year).\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Overall I am aware eBay has been on the decline the last few years, but I believe this year could be the turnaround.  The stock is at an ATH so tread lightly but I believe this earnings run up could be pretty significant.  My target estimate is $65 but I could see it getting up to $70 if their sales for Q2 bring their yearly sales up 10%+ people thought eBay was dying last year so this surge could get people taking them seriously again.\n",

      "Title: GME Interesting Squeeze Facts & Market Cap & Future Valuations : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Sunday, December 20, 2020\n",
      "Content: GME currently sits at a market cap of roughly $1 Billion. ATH was ~$9B cap back in 2007/2008 and a less high ~$6,5B cap in 2013. This would put share price today at $130 and $95 respectively, with the shares outstanding that GameStop currently has (69.75 million).\n",
      "  \n",
      "    For the share price to reach $1000 would \"only\" take a $70B market cap. For reference, other companies with such a market cap include: CSX, CB, BDX, LRCX Don't know who they are? Neither do I. Boomer companies with large caps.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    For a more conservative example, how would a $500 price valuation ($35B cap) look like compared to others in that range? SYY (food distribution), CMG (Chipotle), F (Ford) and EBAY (eBay).\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Even comparing to Best Buy ($26B market cap) would already raise share price to $370\n",
      "  \n",
      "    If Cohen does a complete turnaround for GameStop and makes it a household name in the gaming industry (something like Steam but EVERYTHING gaming related) then I can see $500 becoming pretty reasonable (might even be low-balling it). However even if he takes over that would be mid- to long-term valuations since it would take quite a bit of work to pull off all the changes. So what are we banking on right now? The positive earnings for Q4 + maybe some Cohen news to get the ball rolling to tendie land and maybe a mild short squeeze to help.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Perhaps. Or maybe there's still some chance for an infinity squeeze if MM uses logic.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    With the current share price, for Boomer Sherman & Co to issue the shelf order, it would dilute the shares with an additional 6-7 million shares (to get the $100 million worth). However what if they waited for the share to reach obscene heights (say $1000) they would reach their $100 million with only 100k shares. Thus very minimal dilution would occur.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Obviously this has a lot of speculation in it, so don't take what I said too seriously. I mainly wrote this down so I can visualize it better for myself and confirm my own bias that GME is going to the moon.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Oh and fun fact; according to the ownership list for WSB, we own approximately 3.8 Million shares of GameStop, 5.8% or ~$57 million worth of GME (soon to be Billions). 🚀🚀🚀\n",

Interestingly, if they do decide to revamp their business model they may need that $100M and will undoubtedly need to borrow and go back into debt (many hundreds of millions IMO). If this happen, shorters may jump back in and bet on their failure.

That’s right, whenever the coin jumps high then MSTR will surely follow. Essentially, MSTR is a derivative of the coin.

Big institutions have bought in on this ex: Tesla, JP Morgan, Fidelity, PayPal, Visa, etc... the cat's out of the bag. Is the coin the future tho? Maybe on another discussion, but I doubt it. However, derivatives of the coin (where it falls and rises) I do not doubt. Because the market is overall confusing to me and too many factors are in play for me to consider, MSTR is something that is not. They are a derivative of the coin.\n",

      "    I played this months ago because MSTR would rip up like crazy whenever the forbidden asset would make moves, but lately mstr's moves have been muted whenever forbidden asset goes uppies. I believe what has happened was that MSTR was being used as a proxy for people that couldn't, or wouldn't, buy said forbidden asset but wanted exposure. MARA/RIOT fall in this category too. Think like pension fund managers or whatever. Now that COIN has ipo'd, COIN is clearly the superior proxy. I wouldn't touch MSTR until whatever money that was using it as a proxy has rotated out, should be clear once the price action starts to mirror forbidden asset once more.\n",

      "    Going to be honest with you, ~$50 is probably a fair valuation for eBay in a post covid world. They had a good run since the March crash, but I don't see as much upside compared to other tech companies. I would probably give it a Hold rating like the majority of analysts.\n",

      "Content: Fellow regarded degenerates, I have stumbled across something interesting. It's risky, but that's why we're here. The investment group that Ryan Cohen partnered with to take over gaym stonk is actively working on taking over another business.\n",

      "The company\n",
      "\n",
      "    You know how when you buy something on ebay or etsy the tracking info always says the package is being sent from Pitney Bowes? That's it. That's the company. Pitney Bowes is a shipping and mailing company that's been around for a long time. They work with ebay sellers, etsy sellers, small businesses, most of the fortune 100 companies, government offices, etc to help with shipping logistics. They do not compete directly with UPS or FedEx. In fact, their last mile delivery is handled by the USPS. They mostly deal with shipping headaches. Want to ship a package internationally but don't know how to handle customs? They'll handle it for you. Need to ship lithium batteries or hazardous materials between office locations? They'll make sure it's handled correctly. Want to mail an advertisement to everyone in the state of Georgia? They'll presort it by zip code so the post office charges less. Seriously, 90% of Fortune 100 companies use Pitney Bowes.\n",

      "    Interestingly, PBI is starting from a stronger position than the video game store did. PBI is actually a profitable company - they just aren't making as much money as they used to be, and they should be making a lot more money than they are.\n",
      "  \n",
      "The Takeover\n",
      "\n",
      "    Hestia - the investment group Ryan Cohen worked with to take over the vidya game store - believes Pitney Bowes management sucks, and PBI would be better off with stronger leadership. Hestia started out trying to play nice, but it hasn't gone well so they've staged a proxy fight to try and get their own leadership onto the board of Pitney Bowes. You can see Hestia's presentation here. It has interesting stuff. The proposed business model is straightforward, there's the usual debt restructuring, basic stuff ... and then we get to \"Hey, maybe with less crony capitalism you would make better decisions\". They're particularly pissed that the CEO has nominated personal friends to join the board. Hestia is proposing putting qualified people on the board instead, and they include bios for their nominees. https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20230412005354/en/1761740/1/Hestia_Capital_Investor_Presentation_Transform_Pitney_Bowes.pdf?download=1\n",
      "\n",
      "    There's also a website dedicated to the effort. Hestia is using this to educate investors on the takeover attempt. They have a whole business plan, turnaround strategy, the works: https://www.transformpitneybowes.com/\n",
      "\n",
      "Short Interest\n",
      "\n",
      "    So, I mentioned gaym stonk a couple of times. That's to highlight that this group is serious and has a history of success. However, this is not the same situation. About 6.59% of PBI shares are held short, which is not a high level of short interest. However, volume is so low that at current trading levels it would take 18 days to cover. This means an upward catalyst could cause extra buying pressure, but there will not be a short squeeze. This is purely a value play.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Ways To Play\n",
      "\n",
      "    If you want a short term play, May 9th is the date. That is the annual meeting, and is when the proxy vote is held. Assuming Hestia succeeds, expect a 20 - 30% pop shortly after the shareholder meeting. This will be the market pricing in the turnaround. I'm playing this with 05/19 $3 calls, because there is extremely little IV priced in. If you like gambling, the 05/19 $4 calls are a little more risky but they would be a double bagger on a 20% pop and a 5x on a 30% pop.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    If you want a long term play, Hestia has a $15/share price target on PBI. Wanna be boring? Buy shares and wait 2 years. Want leverage? I'm playing this with a mix of 01/19/2024 LEAP calls with a mix of strikes at $4 and $5. The 01/19/2024 LEAPs with a $7 strike are also tempting just because they're cheap as hell, but it might take longer than 8 months to see results from the turnaround. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hestia-announces-pitney-bowes-interim-120229278.html\n",
      "\n",
      "    If you want a sure thing, mark May 9th on your calendar. If Hestia wins the proxy vote, buy into the rally. You would miss out on some gains, but it's not like the stock is going straight to $15. There'll be plenty of time to buy.\n",

      "Positions\n",
      "\n",
      "    I have a bunch of calls. I have ITM calls for 05/19 (hoping to cash in on a pop after the annual meeting), and OTM calls for Jan 2024.\n",

I don't know which is micro/macro on scale or short/long term but I'd suspect its collapsing from the inside if they are winding up fees at the same time battling perceptions of product quality through this intensive sneaker authentication program.

      "    Etsy's dead, Fred. Once a neat niche marketplace that's had its legs cut out by big box bezos tentaclease since it tried to compete with them for some reason. I see no value in Etsy since it no longer does what it set out to be and I think most people feel the same. Therefore, I am very bullish on it's future stock price. Seems like a winner.\n",

Should see $50.50 by EOD. The wedge has finally consolidated and we should get our $55 price target within 2 weeks.\n",

It doesn't get involved in shipping unless it is global, then it uses its own freight forwarding to backout fx, shipping, and custom. This is a big differentiator in the platform and solves the main pain point. But it does not get into the 2-day free shipping etc, as it is logistically convoluted and costly. It also does not alienate sellers or try to compete for their business.\n",

      "Date: Tuesday, June 08, 2021\n",
      "Content: Sure SI is high, possible gamma/short squeeze, etc etc. That's all documented in other posts. I want to talk about some other information on this stock. If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?\n",
      "  \n",
      "Valuation:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Earning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing\n",
      "  \n",
      "    P/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)\n",
      "  \n",
      "numbers from the latest 8-k and 10-q:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Revenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending ~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    One of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example WISH recently partner with the south african postal services, indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Balance book:\n",
      "\n",
      "    WISH has $1.6B cash. ~$2B total assets, ~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Insider selling:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Another concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Technicals:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Again, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Conclusions:\n",
      "\n",
      "    From a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of ~1, and that would be absurd.\n",

      "Content: So, I had some drinks a few nights ago and decided to do some Due Diligence Under the Influence and ended up going down the rabbit hole of looking over BABA. I’ve made money from them years ago, but have never felt comfortable taking a strong position in them even though their financials always seem decent. Anyways, I left myself a note in my phone with some rough figures focusing mainly on comparing their financials and site traffic to their competitors.\n",

      "    Has anyone else taken this approach before? I don’t remember what all sites Crown & Coke me sourced this data from, so I’m not sure how accurate it is. I do believe it was all mostly from the same source though so should possibly be comparable. I’ve tried this before quite a while ago and came to basically the same conclusion.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    BABA seems to outperform other ecommerce sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy in revenue per visit in spite of having higher bounce rates along with the majority of their consumer base being from countries with much lower median annual incomes than their competitors.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Maybe there’s a flaw in my reasoning or figures, but the last time I did this it convinced me that maybe I should put my money elsewhere and considering how the stock has performed since then I’m glad I did. The PE is tempting, but my instinct says leave this alone completely and don’t bother with taking either side of the trade. If anyone is long or short BABA I’d be interested to hear your reasoning behind your position.\n",

Several of the categories which I sell have views and sales up 6-10% from last year. They are also aggressively incentivizing new listing by offering 50,000 free listings for sellers through June. (They will still get the revenue from final value fees). Finally, with people sitting at home, many are starting to sell their crap. The only sticky thing in my mind is I have seen the traffic and sales increasing more in April than March, so it might not be reflected in the EPS.\n",

      "    I used to shop on eBay for a lot of things... been using them since 05... have a few thousand feedbacks as just a buyer so I’ve done thousands of transactions. I’m hardly using them anymore. The reason is 1. If. Need something fast, Amazon is by far better as getting items in 2-3 days, Ebays timelines are far from guaranteed. 2. Sales tax. Effective last October, for many states, mine included, they are charging sales tax on ALL transactions... even if the item is used. Kinda crazy, so everything is 8% more expensive for me. 3. Opportunistic resellers - eBay isn’t the cheapest option anymore for new items. Most of the time I can find items I want cheaper at a big box retailer than some random person is trying to sell their item for online. Just My 2 cents but I don’t use them anymore for the above reasons\n",

      "    I used to buy and sell on there with 5 different accounts (one of them made it to power seller status). I stopped buying a long time ago when amazon prime first came out.  I stopped selling because I sold my power seller store. I noticed a difference in how they provided support to my other seller accounts and always sided with buyer complaints. I feel this cultivated a “Walmart like” customer base that abuses the system eBay has set up, including sellers. Also, if you’re a new seller they will limit the visibility of your listings, which greatly reduces the amount of bids or offers you get. So I see this as them only providing any help to established sellers and not cultivating any new sellers. When you reduce the new sellers competing for customers, you reduce the reasons why a customer would want to come shop in the first place. They are killing themselves on both sides.\n",

I asked to provide detail. They copied and pasted part of the troubleshooting manual, then escalated the issue to eBay, which forced me to pay full return shipping. When I received the item the rechargeable battery was still in its packaging and it was obvious the item had never been setup. But the buyer still managed to damage the drone when they tried to cram it back in the box.\n",

This is where everything Ebay favor due to the new Xbox, PS5, Nvidia new card, AMD cards and chips. They are all in shortage due to scalpers making big money reselling them on ebay.

      "What is a Spinoff?\n",
      "\n",
      "    When a company creates a new independent company by selling or distributing new shares of its existing business, this is called a spinoff.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Why is a Spinoff advantageous?\n",
      "\n",
      "    The most typical reason for a spinoff is that the stock price of a large, diversified company does not fully reflect the value of all its diverse components.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Another reason may be that a parent company has built a valuable fast-growing subsidiary whose business differs from the main business of the parent company.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Spinoff structure\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"In a traditional spin-off, a parent corporation distributes the shares of a wholly-owned subsidiary on a pro rata basis to the shareholders of the parent company. At a date certain, the two entities’ shares begin to trade separately. In many instances, the shares of the soon to be spun-off entity begin to trade on a forward-delivery basis before share distribution. Parent shares continue to trade as they were, except that the value of the parent stock is adjusted downward on the spin-off ex-dividend date. Following that date, an investor can purchase shares in the parent and the spun-off subsidiary as separate entities. As with previous studies, we are interested in U.S.\"\n",

      "  \n",
      "    On the day of the spinoff, the stock price of the parent company typically drops to reflect the fact that certain assets have been removed from its books.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    In a typical spinoff, the prices of the parent company’s and spinoff’s stocks should add up to the price of the old parent company stock prior to the spinoff, at least initially. This might not be the case for BBBY and BABY. Why? Due to BBBY being in the retail meme basket and any positive news could have an overwhelming large impact on the share price.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Spinoffs shares can lose value for a period of time after the new company is created for other reasons, as well. The drop can be due to parent company shareholders selling their spinoff shares. Some institutional shareholders such as index funds may sell shares because a spinoff isn't part of the benchmark they follow. Other institutions may sell because the spinoff doesn't meet their investment criteria.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The share price of the parent company can rise when spinoff plans are announced if investors believe such a move is financially beneficial.\n",

      "    RC’s letter to BBBY’s board:\n",
      "  \n",
      "    “Seek to Monetize the Ultimate Destination for Babies – Another path that can streamline Bed Bath’s strategy and unlock value trapped within the Company’s underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the BABY banner. Given that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023 with a double-digit growth profile and at least 50% digital penetration, we believe it is likely much more valuable than the Company’s entire market capitalization today.”\n",
      "  \n",
      "    “Assuming continued growth and low double-digit margins, we estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis. We believe under the right circumstances, BABY could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other ecommerce-focused retailers, and justify a valuation of several billion dollars.”\n",
      "  \n",
      "My commentary:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Counter Argument: There is the emergence of valuation rotation from growth to value. Growth stocks have retraced from their ATHs and public market investors are focused on profitability. This rotation could negatively impact BABY’s ability to receive a valuation based upon revenue.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Counter Argument: BABY isn’t an ecommerce retailer YET. This means you have to consider where the majority of revenue is generated NOW and LATER. RC states a “50% digital penetration” but Q4 2021 digital revenue declined by mid-single digits. Reviewing historic quarters, BABY growth has been through stores not digital.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    We need to consider which scenario will provide more value to BBBY, BABY, and shareholders. When calculating BABY’s value, we need to make variety of assumptions including growth, EBITDA margin, debt, and capital expenditures. Most of these figures are not explicitly listed in BBBY’s SEC filings or investor presentations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Scenario 1) Spinoff\n",
      "\n",
      "    Using L Brands and Victoria’s Secret as a guide to determining what value BBBY could unlock by spinning off BABY, we can assume a spinoff is advantageous for BBBY shareholders. I assumed a 1 for 1 share distribution for BABY shareholders. Meaning, for every one share you own of BBBY you would receive 1 share of BABY.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I believe a spinoff of BABY could be worth more than BBBY’s current market cap. The combined share prices, I believe, would be north of $35/share.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    BBBY’s current EV/Revenue multiple is far below peers, trading at .18x revenue where the average is 1.4x and only retail is .83x.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    Using mgmt.’s 2022 guidance of $1.5bn and single digit EBITDA growth, I believe BABY could be worth $1.6bn or $20/share. I also believe BBBY’s current share price of $15 is below what it should be trading at after the BABY spinoff.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I assumed a certain portion of debt and cash would be transferred to BABY during the spinoff. This would lessen the debt load of BBBY (but not significantly).\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The combined share price of $36/share is substantially higher than BBBY's current share price of $15/share. At $36/combined share price it implies an upside of 240%.\n",

      "Scenario 2) Private Equity buyout\n",
      "\n",
      "    If BBBY chooses this strategy, valuation considerations will be different because the acquirer is different. PE firms are financial buyers, they want to leverage acquisitions and increase returns as much as possible. This means they will buy at lower enterprise values, typically a multiple of EBITDA not sales.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    A PE buyer could increase the EV/EBITDA multiple to make their offer appealing enough for BBBY mgmt.\n",
      "  \n",
      "DCF Commentary\n",
      "\n",
      "    I used mgmt.’s forward guidance on BABY estimating sales to hit $1.5bn in 2022. I used a 10% growth projection following the acquisition due to BABY being able to operate separately from BBBY’s hindrance. I slow growth to 8% by 2026.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I used mgmt.’s statement of low single digit EBITDA margin to estimate future EBITDA growth.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I assumed a PE buyer would have to make an appealing offer (because a spinoff is very appealing) to acquire BABY. I assume they would use a 17.5x EBITDA multiple, which is 75% higher than the peer group.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The Enterprise value I project is $1.4bn (1x sales) which implies a $18 share price. This share price is currently higher than the combined BBBY and BABY company.\n",

      "  \n",
      "    I believe the sale of BABY would allow BBBY to focus on its core competencies, pay down all long-term debt, renovate stores, and continue their share repurchase program.\n",
      "   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    I believe BBBY’s share price would re-rate to $45/share after BABY’s sale. This is still far below their peer group based on a P/S multiple.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    At $45/share this implies and upside of 300%+.\n",

      "  \n",
      "    L Brands issued 91,582,866 shares of VSCO. VSCO received multiple offers ranging between $1bn (Sycamore Partners) to $3bn. L Brands felt VSCO would be worth more if spinoff, between $5bn - $7bn. VSCO went public at $40/share or a $3.6bn market cap.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    BBWI (formerly L Brands) reached $80/share right before the spinoff. When VSCO went public BBWI immediately corrected to hitting $59/share.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    The combined share prices of VSCO and BBWI totaled $99/share. BBWI’s share price has continued to perform well and by spinning off VSCO, L Brands unlocked significant shareholder value.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    If you owned L Brands prior to the spinoff, your share price was $80/share. After the spinoff, the combined share price was $99/share. The combined shares ran to over $100/share in the following months. The spinoff unlocked value for shareholders of both L Brands and VSCO.\n",

      "    Extremely high conversion rate compared to the average rate 90% vs 50% which either means it's less error prone or easier to checkout. 400M+ active accounts create a network effect that is meaningful against smaller players but in this case a bit less meaningful against big players that also leverage their platforms. Their scale is still huge at over 1T in volume each year if you just consider e-commerce which is their main business. They also have pretty strong anti-fraud and conflict resolution capabilities which gives them an edge. Normally that would be considered a very strong moat but because of the size of competition it's just a narrow moat.

      "\n",
      "    3) Companies in S Korea, unlike SEA or China, are extremely \"Chaebol\". The large brick and mortar retailers have historically marked up their products. The standard was to sell something for multiple times MSRP Lately they have been getting destroyed by e-commerce and most of the e-commerce is being destroyed by Coupang. Ebay Korea has been looking to sell their position in the market for a fraction of the valuation of Coupang, but nobody is interested in buying. The number of competitors mean nothing.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    4) Coupang owns the entire supply chain, up and down. They own the inventory and they own the drivers and warehouses. Their algorithms are extremely good as well and it is catered to the Korea audience. As they gain control of this market and crush out the competition, Coupang will have significantly more pricing power. Their Amazon Price subscription is mere $2.5 USD a month.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    5) Receiving $4.6 billion dollars in cash is absolutely insane, given that we've been able to see how far they have been able to stretch the $3 billion from SoftBank.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    6) Coupang has demonstrate the deepest ability to monetize their consumers in the market. $SE has leaned on its extremely profitable gaming arm Garena to fuel infrastructure. But market depth and consumer service quality is unparalleled. Consumers trust Coupang enough to buy groceries on a daily basis.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    7) This company trades a significant discount to its peers for a few reasons, the lack of an AWS-like product. The reality is, Coupang is currently deploying the $4 billion dollars to tack on higher margin technology services. If you look at the second revenue line, the other sources of income is currently small, but growing rapidly.  The company looks poised to completely control a passive, wealthy and easily marked up audience upselling them on a wide range of products unheard of in other e-commerce platforms. Once that objective is completed, their services become exponentially more valuable.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    8) Currently sales are $11 billion dollars, looking to trend to $22 billion in sales for next year. Best Buy currently trades at $16 billion in sales and is roughly $30 billion, which is roughly about what Coupang trades in line at (~ currently priced at $50 billion but adding on a much faster growth rate would place the company north of that line, $80 billion is rich but reasonable). The key thing is that adding additional product lines has been very easy. Kroger alone has about $60 billion in perishable food sales and Coupang is the only e-commerce company in the world to really have controlled this type of market. Companies with no foothold in grocery stores are likely never going to have that going forward. Purchases by parents are built on an immense level of trust and are not price sensitive. Chewy sells pet food (another super insensitive purchase category). There's a lot of $$$ to be made here.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    9) The owner is relatively good at pivoting and one hell of an operator so realistically you will not be able to buy the stock before the news comes out when they find their best new hot thing to drop $4.6 billion on. The best thing to do is wait for this stock to trade sideways for a while and pick up what you can while the narrative is focused on the inability to leave their home country (which ultimately will be the story for every e-commerce investment).\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "    10) Hostility to Coupang being unable to enter other spaces is overblown, other than general hatred for Chinese and the Japanese having hatred for specifically Koreans and humorous hatred for foreigers who don't take the time to learn a culture, there is no reason why Coupang can't compete in SEA. I've never seen this level of market domination in a competitive environment with reasonable profitability outside of Amazon. $SE has the advantage of Blue Skies and SEA gamer boys, but nobody can club heads like Coupang.\n",

Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing 🧐. Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   “if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.”  To me is very strange to see $WISH CEO steps down so easily, he seems someone that would fight until the end and we saw that on the past.. For that reason I think that we would have a buyout coming.. So let’s put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track of a potentail buyout opportunity or a great future growth.\n",

I had a customer who wanted a full refund but didn't want to ship the product back. It was fucking expensive and I wasn't going to give a 100% refund without a return. The client left negative feedback. I requested eBay to remove it because I offered the customer 3-4 solutions. I got the bad review but I also got to keep the money.\n",

      "For the neckbeards out there I will give a quick explanation of what PayPal is...\"It's is an online financial service that allows you to pay for items using a secure internet account. You simply add your bank account, credit card or debit card details and whenever you pay using PayPal, you can choose which of your cards or accounts it pays with. You can also set one to be the default payment method and that will be used unless you choose otherwise\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They also own these companies:\n",
      "Venmo\n",
      "    As we mentioned above, Venmo was already part of Braintree when the company was acquired by PayPal in 2013. Venmo was established in 2009 as a mobile payment solution, specialising in P2P payments. The payment method app is commonly used by restaurant customers, who utilise it to split the tab between different diners. Venmo handled $12 billion in transactions in Q1 of 2018. Venmo is considered a miniature part of PayPal’s mobile payment volume. Nonetheless, the company is regarded as the fastest-growing online payment solution.\n",
      "  Paydiant\n",
      "    Founded in 2010, Paydiant is another mobile payments solution acquired by PayPal. Paydiant is an e-Wallet platform which offers mobile payments, offers, ATM cash access, and many more. Some of the most famous brands operating with Paydiant are Subway, Best Buy, etc. The e-commerce company was acquired by PayPal in 2015 for $280 million. According to specialists, PayPal conducted the acquisition in order to develop e-Wallet applications. Playdiant has been successful ever since the company was established. Nevertheless, becoming a part of PayPal’s mobile payments volume has certainly influenced the company expansion in a positive way.\n",
      "  Xoom Corporation\n",
      "    The same year PayPal acquired Playdiant, the online payments giant also acquired Xoom Corporation. The business is yet another online money transfer solution, highly praised for its superb safety and reliability. PayPal paid $890 million to acquire Xoom Corporation, which the online money transfer company used in order to expand its worldwide influence, targeting new markets in India and China. Currently, Xoom Corporation operates in more than 70 different countries.\n",
      "  Modest\n",
      "    Modest was founded in Chicago in 2012. The company focuses on improving customer experience and allows online retailers to drag and drop purchase buttons so that customers can see and buy products without leaving the current page. PayPal acquired Modest, aiming to expand into a branch of the e-commerce business termed contextual commerce. Modest worked together with Braintree to make sure that online retailers have all things necessary to embed buy buttons where they wanted.\n",
      "  Swift Financial\n",
      "    Swift Financial, an online loan company, was founded in 2006. PayPal acquired the company in 2017 for $183 million. According to data, at the time of the acquisition, Swift Financial had supported more than 20,000 small businesses.\n",
      "  iZettle\n",
      "    What stimulated PayPal’s interest in the European financial technology company was a statement made by iZettle representatives. In it, company representatives commented they were planning to introduce their business on the stock market. After PayPal announced its intention to acquire the company, however, iZettle terminated the IPO process. As mentioned above, iZette is a financial technology company which allows its clients to conduct payments via their mobiles. The online payments solution operates in Latin America and Europe.\n",
      "  Hyperwallet\n",
      "    Hyperwallet is a company for financial technology which was founded in 2000. The company provides clients with online payout platforms for financial institutions as well as market businesses. The enterprise supports a wide variety of currencies and offers many payment options, such as prepaid cards, cash pickups, etc. In June 2018, PayPal acquired Hyperwallet for $400 million in order to extend its online payment solutions to e-commerce platforms all over the gl PayPal Holdings revenue for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was $5.261B, a 22.21% increase year-over-year.\n",
      "  eBay (somewhat)\n",

      "Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2020\n",
      "Content: EBay Inc. EBAY shares were initially up 2% in after-hours trading Tuesday before dropping to -4% after the e-commerce company reported fiscal second-quarter results roughly in line with Wall Street estimates. EBay reported net income of $740 million, or $1.04 a share, compared with net income of $402 million, or 46 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, EBay reported net income of $770 million, or $1.08 a share, compared with $589 million, or 68 cents a share a year ago. Revenue improved 18% to $2.87 billion from $2.69 billion a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected adjusted net income of 79 cents a share on sales of $2.8 billion. EBay's shares have improved 56% this year. The broader S&P 500 index SPX is up 0.4% in 2020.\n",

Also, they want to lecture in critical thinking but couldn’t critically think about the fact they were going on live television and perhaps having a script or at least bullet points was a good idea. If in fact they did have bullet points, they appeared to not use them, again a lack of critical thinking. If they did follow their bullet points, everything they said appears to show a lack of critical thinking.\n",

      "Content: First of all it's not a financial advice so please do your own DD before investing on anything and only invest the amount you are fully prepared to loose! Also if you are a conservative investor, Index fund is far far better and if you are a value investor, there are ton of opportunities out there and always will be. This is a growth bet !\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I am long WISH and I might be little biased; however I am in it to make money so I heartily welcome all LONG BEAR points; not short. Short terms are mostly driven by events and not business fundamentals so WISH could go to $2 if people do not like the new CEO for example ! There is no limit how much low a stock can go unfortunately; please go read Peter Lynch. If you are trying to time the market, good luck!! Also if you are a day trader, good luck to you as well !! - I recently read a post from fellow investor who turned over $28 million in a year and was in negative $7600 :) I personally think it's not worth the time and emotional well being.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    What I have learned during my 5 years investing journey is that stocks mostly move up and down driven by sentiment; it comes down to demand and supply - if people are willing to sell for less OR if there are less buyers than sellers, price moves down. These are mostly driven by `catalysts` - a positive/negative earnings, black/white swan events, macro events or even a PR ! But these moves do not usually last long so unless you are trying to time the market, its very difficult to win most of the time.\n",

Just look at  one year chart of these companies for example - STNE (Warren buffet is an investor), BABA (Charlie Munger), CLOV/OPEN (Chamath); TDOC, CRSP (Cathie Wood) even PayPal and SQ are down big time.

It can even buy small companies to diversify its business, invest in new technology and even buy it's own share (its highly unlikely for growth companies though).

      "Title: PayPal: Outlook Constructive amid the recent pullback : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Thursday, December 09, 2021\n",
      "Content: Call to Action: We see no significant risks to PYPL’s position in the short term and view the 2022 setup favorably. Price target $250.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Thesis: PYPL’s performance will continue into 2022; while facing covid-comps, the combination of organic growth and elimination of drags will bode well for sustained double-digit growth. PYPL’s 2022 Venmo deal with Amazon will sustain growth in transaction volume while also boosting Venmo’s own growth. Continued payments and eCommerce integration affirm confidence after 3Q comps and a softer 4Q guidance.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Expanded Payments: PYPL noted that Buy Now, Pay Later TPV run rate exceeds $8B annually, and new initiatives and expansions. BNPL is expanding to Spain and Italy, and consumer late fees will be eliminated since October 1st. PYPL continues to expand across payment verticals, with payment solutions with Walmart, Booking.com, AliExpress, etc. PYPL further noted that customers will be able to make purchases on AMZN and mobile shopping app via Venmo after 2022.\n",
      "  \n",
      "PayPal Wallet: PYPL highlighted the global rollout of the digital wallet, and noted early wins in user engagement, driving increased transactions. PYPL Cash Card enrollments increased 35%, first-time alternative-currency users have increased 15%, and first-time donations have increased 35%.\n",
      "  \n",
      "M&A: PYPL highlighted the tuck-in acquisition of Paidy, the leading two-sided payments platform and BNPL provider in Japan, which closed on Oct. 13th. This positions well for the 3rd largest eCommerce market’s pivot towards cashless payments.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Guidance: PYPL’s guidance baked-in headwinds from reopening and cited EBAY as a continued drag on performance. Management currently expects around 18% revenue growth for 2022, with a reacceleration of revenues in 2H22 following a flatter 1H. Overall, management expects above medium-term guidance.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Key Takeaways: PYPL’s initiatives continue to boost organic growth in transaction volume and user engagement. With the expiration of the PYPL-eBay deal, performance drag will be reduced. However, in the short term, tough prior-year comps and project maturation both point toward a flatter 1H22. The long-term setup is more positive with secular growth in cashless payments.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Estimates and Valuation: My price target of $250 is using a forecasted 2026 Diluted Non-GAAP EPS, with a terminal EPS multiple of 26, a discount rate of 9%. This means the stock currently trades at 13.14x times Terminal EPS.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Downside Risks: increased credit losses from the BNPL segment, accelerated take-rate reductions, slowdown in transaction volume growth from normalization, poor choice of acquisitions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Upside Risks: outperformance in transaction volume and revenue growth, Acceleration in Venmo and cashless transaction uptake, any slowdown in take-rate reductions, positive consumer behavior changes.\n",

      "   \n",
      "    I think the primary reason PYPL sold off was due to the weaker 4Q guidance and their remarks about 1H22. From PYPL's perspective, this makes sense with reopening and more difficult comparisons as COVID boosted the move towards cashless payments.\n",

      "   \n",
      "    The new vertical expansions with Walmart, AliExpress, and Bookings.com also are good, getting those big labels online with more merchants. This really complements their Venmo deal with Amazon.\n",

      "    To show you how stupid I was, I bought 2500 shares the day before Enron declared bankrupt for 25 cents each.  They were going to have a 65 cent dividend in just a month later.  How could I lose?  Their financials showed they had a debt of 5 billion and they had raised over like 10 billion in the few weeks before with 50 billion in assets.  The next day they were bankrupt and the stock went to 75 cents and I unloaded everything I had.  Unfortunately I had accumulated 200 shares at an average price of $15.  So I was still underwater, but not as much.  I don't trust anything financially that I read after that.  They had this crazy idea at the time that they were going to send movies over the internet for a fee.  At the time it took 5 minutes to download a short postage stamp size movie over the internet.  They knew.\n",

      "Date: Tuesday, February 15, 2022\n",
      "Content: COMPANY ANALYSIS: PAYPAL HOLDINGS, INC. (NASDAQ: PYPL)\n",
      "    PYPL is a payment and digital wallet service provider that has 392 million consumer active accounts and 34 million merchant active accounts. It gets paid primarily by collecting a fee on payments made on its network, which totaled $1.25 trillion in 2021. The company is diversified globally and entrenched in habits of both consumers and merchants. Currently, PYPL trades at around $115 a share, which represents 23x P/FCF (net cash).\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Competition is fierce and when management guided to significantly slower growth (scrapped 2025 goal of reaching 750 million active users and slashed 2022 target for new users to 15-20 million), the share price got cut by 25% at the beginning of February. This recent price action merits PYPL a closer look.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    We love growth, but we also love cash flow. PYPL is growing revenue at a double-digit pace and generates 22 cents in free cash flow on every dollar of revenue. If we assume that revenue stays at $28 billion run-rate, then free cash flow per share is over $5.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Buying a company that generates $5 a year in free cash flow and growing above trend for $115 (23x) could be a bargain in the current market environment (S&P 500’s median is 35x).\n",
      "  \n",
      "    POSITIONS: My positions are options spreads to minimize risk (in exchange for capping some of the profit). I prefer this to buy & hold for non-dividend yielding assets. Here's an example to make up to 12.1% (21.6% annualized) and start to lose only if $PYPL drops by more than 22% through 9/16/2022.\n",

(Check the feedback on tons of Amazon marketplace sellers and you will see how ridiculous a threshold this was) What was even more ridiculous was in the beginning all categories were treated the same. For example Books were treated the same way as used women's clothing. Certain categories like womens clothing were DECIMATED by sellers being banned.  People who had been on the platform for a decade and had say a 97% positive feedback selling USED WOMENS CLOTHING were banned left and right.  It gets worse, remember how at 98.9% they would put you on probation? Some people called this the DEATH SPIRAL as if you were on probation the new “Best Match” system would lower your search standing.  So if you were some poor schmuck who had sold 397 used pieces of womens clothing that year and just 4 of them were unhappy with the experience. You’d go on probation with little to no hope of anything other than the ban hammer.  I’ve read many period era messageboard posts of long time sellers in probation trying to do EVERYTHING they could to raise their DSR to get out of probation but had zero visibility with the new algo, they were just left to wither on the vine hoping fruitlessly to turn things around. Most of them didn’t know it YET but eventually as people started putting the pieces together there was no chance of them escaping the Death Spiral. Gaggles of people spent MONTHS trying to save their accounts and eventually most of them realized they were screwed, there was nothing they could do about it because of the Algos.  These sellers turned on ebay and took others with them.\n",

      "  \n",
      "    I've spent a few hours trawling eBay seller message boards. Within this quarter I have heard of increases in per transactions and a decrease in \"Best Offers\" which means better margins for sellers and more fees for eBay. I attribute this to Corona disrupting normal supply chains. eBay has been established for many years so boomers when they can’t find something are like \"Oh Yeah EBAY.\" Many sellers report increased sells in business related categories and more aged inventory being sold as parts of the market shift towards online from some of the traditionally Bricks and Mortar industries.  eBay has a very successful and well made app.  Sellers are seeing increased usage amongst younger buyers/sellers whom are either bored with the lockdowns or looking for side income after losing their jobs.  Remember when we mentioned 500 small sellers being worth more than one big corporate client?  This will be obtained with an army of people using the app on their cell phones.  Corona is going to get the attention of customers they lost over the years as they come back to the platform they remember, millennials and new users when they discover the well made app will come online. I've added the eBay App to my phone it is very good and has very customizable search features.\n",

      "    I had puts on this bad boy previously but I bought them too early. I concur 100% that eBay will be reporting losses. They screwed everyone through the 2000s by nickel and diming all the sellers. Now there are better places to find stuff: stockx, goat, poshmark, mercari, offer up, hell even Facebook marketplace is eating up market share. While I do know that eBay has many subsidiaries, they are a dying platform that I pray will continue to bleed\n",

      "    I’m a power seller on eBay, my sales are up from last year. They’ve seemed to fix some of the issues that happened last quarter. However I’m not a fan of the new mobile app layout, it takes longer to create a listing now. I think it might get a pop if the price keeps going down before earnings. They’ll say they started to move away from PayPal and say how much they are saving from that.\n",

      "Date: Wednesday, January 04, 2017\n",
      "Content: So I recently posted an auction-style item for sale on Ebay. I set it for a week with a reserve price (minimum price met in order for item to be sold). On the final day, some random dude came in a made a bid at my exact reserve price 10 minutes before the auction closed. I requested Ebay to collect the $$ for me by filing out a case; however, didn’t help. Then today, as I woke up, I saw a $125 automatic withdrew from my paypal account from Ebay claiming for their service fees with the description “PREAPPROVED PMT.” I’m pretty sure I didn’t approve such shit show. Anyway, long story short, I called Ebay and demanded my hard earned / RH $$, and they were willing to refund the full $125 but stated I had to wait for 30 days to transfer it back to Paypal. I told the guy about this fake bot who bidded on my item and was told nobody except me could look into my “RESERVE PRICE.” Yeah, right, screw you ebay. Proof: http://imgur.com/a/k4JzN http://imgur.com/a/i03Ti http://imgur.com/a/jWG7T\n",

      "    The $125 fee is totally legit though. That's the standard fee for selling a car that's charged when the auction ends. You \"pre-approved\" it when you checked the Terms and Conditions. That being said, I think eBay should refund you the money because of the bot shenanigans. But the $125 isn't a scam/bs.\n",
      "   \n",
      "    Some people will forget to request their refund. Imagine some big sellers or whatever. Ebay told me the $125 cannot go back to paypal for 30 days. My concern is that can they recognize my $125 and other people' $$ on their balance sheet? Then refund it after 30 days or even pocket it if people forget?\n",

      "Date: Thursday, June 17, 2021\n",
      "Content: Today we’ll take a dive into JMIA (Jumia) Africa’s biggest e-commerce company.\n",
      "  \n",
      "I  have a lot of experience in population growth and economic development  in developing countries. Africa is poised to be the next area of rapid  economic growth, now that places like China/Vietnam are having a slow  down. Most continent’s populations will falter over the next half century, the  majority of growth will take place on the African Continent - �� Graph of Human Population Growth - From Business Insider\n",
      "\n",
      "    I  am betting on JMIA holding down and expanding their footprint on the  African continent as they poise themselves to grow along with the  continent.\n",
      "  \n",
      "TLDR - Ideal stock for day trading as it bounces like a kangaroo. Otherwise I'd go long, leaps and shares\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s Jumia?\n",
      "\n",
      "    Jumia  is Africa’s biggest e-commerce company. Its core business is focused in  11 countries on the continent representing around 70% of Africa's GDP  and population. Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Ivory Coast,  Egypt, Uganda, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Ghana. They have been  expanding rapidly to get their foot down in as many countries as  possible without stretching themselves too thin. They have a business  model similar to ebay, in that many products are sold by private  sellers. Since the start of the pandemic, they have pivoted their  business to also deliver groceries as well as take-out food.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Nigeria  is Jumia’s biggest market so here is their website if you would like to  pursue phones, penis pills, or clothing. Browsing their website you can  get an idea of where they’re pivoting their business.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Nigerian Website - www.jumia.com.ng\n",
      "\n",
      "E-Commerce\n",
      "\n",
      "I  am very bullish on JMIA but I will address the bearish argument before  explaining how Jumia has adapted quickly to address these issues and get  on track to profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The  bearish argument against JMIA and the question many people ask  themselves when considering e-commerce in Africa is logistics. Africa  has some of the worst infrastructure when considering the movement of  people and goods. Both due to poor road/transportation networks as well  as a dizzying amount of bureaucracy and little cooperation between  neighboring countries.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    While  unrelated to Jumia, this American guy who’s a truck driver in Africa can  give you an idea of the difficulties of traveling - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslPzhFLyas\n",
      "\n",
      "    Even urban centers don’t have addresses which makes the delivery of goods a big game of cat and mouse. This video from 2019  can give you an idea of problems that Jumia was facing.  As you can see  in that video the biggest issue they’ve had since starting their  business is getting packages into people’s hands at a faster rate.  According to their 2021 Q1 Earnings Report  Jumia has 1,600 pick up stations across Africa, something which they  didn’t even have in 2019. It is the same concept as Amazon Lockers,  where a person’s goods are put in a locker to be picked up at their  convenience. 23% of packages delivered in Q1 were to pick up stations.  During their Q1 earnings, the company stated the potential of their pick  up stations\n",
      "  \n",
      "    “We view pick-up  stations as a strategic asset for the future growth of our platform. In  addition to providing more convenience options for consumers and cheaper  delivery costs, they are physical touch points that bring the Jumia  brand closer to consumers. We are increasingly leveraging them as  ordering points where consumers can place orders with the help of the  pick-up station staff which helps educate consumers and build further  trust.”\n",
      "  \n",
      "    To give you an idea of their use in more remote regions -\n",
      "  \n",
      "    “some  countries such as Ivory Coast, pick-up stations are proving to be a  compelling alternative to door delivery and a key tool to expand  e-commerce penetration beyond primary cities. We see meaningful  opportunity in supporting equitable economic development in secondary  cities and rural areas, which led us to establish a scalable pick-up  station model in partnership with CDC, the UK’s development finance  institution. These outlets serve as both pick-up stations and ordering  points. They are operated by local entrepreneurs who earn income from  the delivery fees they receive on package delivery and commissions on  orders placed from the outlet.”\n",
      "  \n",
      "    To show what they mean, here is a long list of pick up stations in Kenya- https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/\n",
      "\n",
      "    Another  issue noted in the video is pay-on-delivery which has been immensely  popular for them when they had initially started. Even when someone  tries to use a card they often have issues with mobile card readers. For  this reason Jumia had started JumiaPay - Their example video - https://youtu.be/Wh7KsLyO0PA\n",
      "\n",
      "    JumiaPay  enables users of Jumia to connect bank accounts and separate cards all  in one place, a great convenience especially for anyone selling on  Jumia. Described in an interview with the CEO of a website I can't mention,  JMIA sees JumiaPay as an introduction into mobile banking for Africa, a  place that has not has much exposure to mobile banking.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    They’re  so bullish on their business that the CEO stated “The company wants to  be in a position to spinoff Jumia Pay and Jumia Logistics when it  becomes relevant enough to consider, he said. Although, he noted Jumia  is \"years away\" from considering spinoffs of those assets”\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Since  2020, they have started their own in house advertising agency, Jumia  Advertising, an” in-house digital advertising agency catering to both  Jumia sellers and third parties, ran over 283 campaigns on behalf of 137  advertisers. These include high profile partners such as l’Oreal, Leroy  Merlin, Adidas, Unilever, Danone and many more.”\n",
      "  \n",
      "Jumia Food -  they have been running Jumia food for more than 9 years and now and  basically have their own DASH business. As you can expect, the business  has done well during the pandemic. Here is an interview with the CEO on Kenyan Public Television, he explains the success they have had during the pandemic.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    As  you can tell, JMIA is coming out to take over the e-commerce space in  Africa. While they have smaller/regional competitors, none of them have  the footprint and services like Jumia. Which is what makes me extremely  bullish on JMIA in the long term.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    My  conviction to go long on JMIA is from my understanding of the long-term  growth and development that will take place in Africa. Jumia stands to  profit immensely from any development in Africa and will continue to  dominate the e-commerce space as more Africans enter the middle class  and want to enjoy the same convenience/luxuries available in The West.  They have shown they're capable of pivoting quickly when needed to fit  the ever changing needs of the respective countries they operate in.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Two  of the biggest takeaways from the UN's 2050 agenda is that by 2050 two  in every five children will be born in Africa and that Urban population  is expected to triple. In Africa, the average age is 19 years old and  rapidly getting younger. The continent is growing so quickly that by  halfway through this century, it will be home to one billion children.\n",

      "    This article from the economist is a great example of the growth that will occur in Nigeria alone - https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050\n",
      "\n",
      "    While  Africa is always slept on when considering business and commerce, it is  one of the last places to be underdeveloped and will bloom once more  manufacturing is relocated to the continent after wages and standard of  living rises high enough in East/SE Asia. Similarly to how many things  were made in Taiwan/South Korea, which then moved to China and now to  Vietnam. As wages rise in these places, manufacturers will move to  Africa in order to take advantage of lax labor laws and low wages,  spurning the continent’s industrial boom.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Short-Term  Potential Roadblocks - While the pandemic has slowed down in the United  States, the large majority of Africans are unvaccinated. Which means  that many countries have/are under travel restrictions and may affect  business in the short-term. However Jumia has fared well over the last  year so I believe they are capable of overcoming any of those challenges  in the short term.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I am not into  astrology so I wont draw any lines on any charts. This is great stock to  make little trades on here and there because of its volume. However at  under 3 billion dollar market cap, I consider this a great time to  invest. I will continue to buy more shares weekly and scalp calls here  and there.\n",

      "Title: A Bear Thesis on GameStop's Fundamentals : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Friday, March 25, 2022\n",
      "Content: As most of you know, the main draw for investing in GME is the MOASS. This post will not be addressing the MOASS. Nor will it be addressing the potential this stock has for swing trading, nor any of the other factors that can inflate a stock's price beyond its fundamental value. What it will address is the group of people (most of whom have already put most or all of their life's savings into this stock) who would like to believe that GME is bound to be a rock-solid investment even without a MOASS because of its strong fundamentals, which position it to become the next Amazon.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    This is somewhat of a cross-post from a post I made in the meltdown DD sub, though I have made a few edits.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    First, let's consider GameStop's starting point. GME is worth over $150/share primarily because it's being held up by swing traders and apes who are invested not primarily because of fundamentals, but because of its high volatility and perceived squeeze potential. Prior to retail becoming so heavily devoted to the squeezing the shorts, GME was being traded for about $4/share. Even before the pandemic, GME was being traded for less than $6/share. We commonly think of GME as a stock that jumped from $20 to $483, but it actually started much lower. Even at $20, it was being held up by investors who were more interested in short squeezes than the company's fundamentals. Of course, there are many apes who believe that GameStop was being shorted into bankruptcy by hedge funds at this time, and that the stock was worth well more than its price even in 2020. The truth, though, is that GameStop was very much a dying brick and mortar company in 2020 and early 2021. That being the case, I'll very generously say that GME was genuinely worth $20/share on fundamentals alone and that it truly earned its market cap of $1.3 billion in early January, 2021. Of course, GME is currently trading for much more than that. At $150/share, GME's stock price is up about 650%, and that's not even taking dilution into consideration. So has GameStop done enough since January 2021 to justify such an extraordinary jump in its stock price?\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Well, the short answer is no. Anyone with any experience in valuing stocks can tell you that, based purely on fundamentals, GameStop hasn't even come close to justifying its 650% increase in stock price, let alone its even larger increase in market cap. It hasn't made any major changes, it's struggling to adapt in its rapidly-changing industry, and it's continuing to lose millions of dollars each quarter. But some people (or, more accurately, some apes) don't see it that way. They'll tell you that GameStop has been undergoing a massive turnaround that easily justifies a stock price in the high triple digits, with many even arguing that the price of a single share should be well into 4 digits. Again, these valuations are given by apes who are supposedly ignoring any squeeze potential and focusing exclusively on fundamentals. They justify these massive valuations with the following:\n",
      "  \n",
      "    - Over a billion dollars in cash and no long-term debt\n",
      "  \n",
      "    - Positive earnings reports\n",
      "  \n",
      "    - Executives leaving companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. to join GameStop, which is paying them exclusively with shares\n",

      "  \n",
      "    - Expanding to sell more than just video games\n",
      "  \n",
      "    There are of course many different apes with many different beliefs, but these 7 points seem to be the main justifications for their extremely bullish arguments. That being the case, I would like to talk about each of these points and why they're not nearly as bullish as apes think they are.\n",

      "Over a Billion Dollars in Cash and No Long-Term Debt\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    In today's economy, taking on debt is almost the same as accepting free money. Yes, you'll have to pay that debt back with interest, but with inflation and interest rates where they are, inflation will likely offset most of the interest anyway. Essentially, if I borrow $10 and have to pay back $11, I can rest easy knowing that by the time I pay the $11 back, it will be worth about what $10 was worth when I initially took out the loan. As such, taking on debt isn't particularly bearish, nor is eliminating debt all that bullish. Likewise, since taking out loans is so easy, having cash on hand isn't all that valuable, either. Granted, having excess cash was never that valuable for major companies--most issues can't be solved by simply throwing money at them, so it's no surprised that countless companies have failed despite having enormous amounts of cash on hand--but it's even less valuable now.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Moreover, most successful companies never keep cash on hand and deliberately take on billions in debt because this gives them what they need to push the envelope and be the first to come up with major innovations. Anyone who sees GameStop as a massive growth tech company should see the fact that its still holding onto a billion dollars that it raised over 9 months ago as a major red flag. A company being unable to invest its cash in the pursuit of major innovations because it needs that money to cover its operating costs is not a good thing. If $20 is GME's starting point, eliminating debt and gaining $2 billion in cash would increase its fundamental value by no more than a few dollars per share. Or at least it would, if not for the way the company made that money.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Don't forget that GameStop didn't eliminate that debt and gain that cash by selling more games and generating more revenue; it did so by offering more shares and diluting its stock. When a stock is diluted, the supply goes up while the demand remains the same. Moreover, each share is now worth a smaller portion of the total company. As such, offering more shares tends to make a stock price go down. That tends to be true even when the money gained from the dilution is being used to finance significant innovations, but it's especially true when the money is simply used to pay off debt and generate excess cash. Realistically, if GME was worth $20 in January 2021, diluting the stock to clear debt and gain cash may make the stock worth less than $20 now.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive Earnings Reports\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    This is a funny one because GME's last few earnings reports weren't remotely positive. On the contrary, they show that this company is continuing to hemorrhage money. The Q4 2021 report showed that GameStop lost $150 million (nearly $2 per share) in that quarter alone. If you're new to earnings reports, that's bad. And that's in Q4, a quarter that historically has been by far the most profitable quarter of the year. Many retailers, including GameStop, frequently lose money the first three quarters then cover their losses with big profits in the fourth.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Of course, earnings reports are very long and measure companies in many different ways. Naturally, most apes ignore the bad numbers (i.e.: almost all of them) and latch on to the few good numbers. After the Q3 report, the most notable of these was net sales compared to the previous year. They made a big deal about how GameStop's net sales went from $1 billion in Q3 2020 to $1.3 billion in Q3 2021 (a 30% increase). However, that's mainly because people were still staying home, quarantining, and avoiding public spaces in Q3 2020 to a much greater extent than they were in Q3 2021. Nearly every brick and mortar retailer (whether it is now or will be in the future, GameStop was definitely a brick and mortar retailer in 2020) saw massive improvements when comparing 2021 to 2020, and many did so without losing over $100 million in a single quarter. Macy's, for example, saw net sales increase by 35%, and it did so while making over $200 million in profit. Furthermore, GameStop's net sales were $1.44 billion in Q3 2019, and $2 billion in Q3 2018. So net sales, the one \"bright spot\" in GameStop's otherwise abysmal Q3 earnings report, are actually down from where they were 2 years ago, and way down from where they were 3 years ago. And note that while COVID is still a factor, it's not nearly as significant as it was in 2020. Many brick and mortar companies have rebounded in 2021 back to where they were in 2019 (Macy's is right back to where it was in 2019), yet GameStop, despite its supposed turnaround, hasn't.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    After the Q4 call, though, even apes haven't had many positive things to say. Other than getting hyped about the NFT marketplace (which I'll address later), they've mostly just been finding excuses for GameStop's horrible losses. Remember how after the Q3 report, apes dismissed that $100 million loss by saying that it was due to increased spending on an aggressive expansion (new call center, new fulfillment center, etc.) that wouldn't hurt future earnings? Well, that's out the window, because now they're saying that the Q4 earnings were affected by more spending on their expansion after all. What exactly was GameStop spending so much money on in Q4? Apes can't tell you, but they're sure that it must be something amazing, and that this $150 million loss must actually be incredibly bullish.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Anyone who looks at the quarter objectively, though, will realize that the loss was caused more by the cost of sales increasing more rapidly than the sales themselves (the former increased over $200 million from Q4 2021 while the latter only increased by about $`130 million) and by GameStop's inability to sell a huge portion of its holiday inventory.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    If GME was worth $20 in January 2021, the most recent earnings report puts its fundamental value well below $20, and its negative impact is far more significant that the slight boost it might have gotten by gaining cash.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    One would think that these GME apes, with all their talk of being the most educated investors in history, would know how common this is. Like all employees, executives frequently leave companies to join other companies for a plethora of potential reasons. I recently left a job at a major company to join a much smaller company. Is that because I think this smaller company is going to take off and leave companies like my previous one in the dust? No, it's because this smaller company was offering a higher profile job with better pay and an easier commute. Likewise, there are many reasons that an Amazon executive may begin looking for other jobs at other companies. Most such executives don't end up working at GameStop, but some do. It's also worth mentioning that many of GameStop's executives have left to join other companies. Apes who present it as though executives are fleeing their high profile jobs to flock to GameStop are simply being disingenuous. In reality, employees (including executives) are just being shuffled around as they always are. Some are leaving GameStop; some are leaving other companies. Some are joining GameStop; most are joining other companies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Paying executives exclusively with shares is also extremely common, bordering on ubiquitous. Nearly every major company does it. It incentivizes the leaders to improve their company, and it's desirable for tax reasons. Frankly, if GameStop didn't pay its executives exclusively with shares, it would be a huge red flag.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    These factors don't affect the stock's fundamental value at all. Again, nearly every major company can say that people from other major companies are coming to them to be paid only with shares.\n",

      "    Let me tell you a story about a company called Quibi. Quibi was a streaming service founded by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jeffrey Katzenberg is an incredibly successful movie producer and media proprietor who was the chairman of Disney from 1984 to 1994 before leaving to become the co-founder and CEO of DreamWorks. Katzenberg oversaw the production of movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin (the original one, not the Will Smith one), Honey I Shrunk the Kids, The Mighty Ducks, Kung Fu Panda, Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and Shrek, among many, many others.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    And Quibi didn't just have a successful founder, either. Its CEO was Meg Whitman. Whitman was the president and CEO of eBay from 1998 to 2008. She saw eBay's annual revenue jump from $4 million to $8 billion, and eBay's stock rose as high as 2900% during her tenure.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Quite frankly, Quibi had an all-star lineup from top to bottom. There were successful producers, ex-Netflix executives, prolific digital marketers, and many others eager to take Quibi (a company that, coincidentally, also had about $2 billion in cash to work with) to the stratosphere. \n",
      "  \n",
      "    Quibi shut down in October 2020, merely 6 months after its launch. It became one of the many companies that have been run into the ground by successful, proven leaders. Great leaders with amazing track records don't make companies immune to failure. This is true for companies like Quibi that are founded by their incredibly talented leaders, but it's even more true for a company like GameStop that's asking its current leaders to undo years of business mistakes made by the people who had been running it. According to apes, since Ryan Cohen was able to beat Amazon within the small niche that is the pet food market, it should be taken as a given that Cohen will beat Amazon at everything forever and eventually create a giant corporation that overthrows Amazon entirely. Unfortunately, that's just not how things work.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Ryan Cohen is a brilliant businessman, and he's surrounded himself with many other talented businesspeople. But that doesn't guarantee growth or success. A solid plan from GameStop might guarantee growth and success, but GameStop hasn't announced any plans. Of course, I can respect keeping a plan close to your chest and away from your competitors, but we shouldn't blindly assume that the plan is golden just because Cohen and co. are the ones coming up with it. If GME was worth $20 on fundamentals in January 2021, the mere addition of Cohen and his team does make it more valuable, but only slightly (likely not enough to offset the dilution and poor earnings). The claims that Cohen's presence alone is enough to justify a $100 billion market cap for GameStop are just ludicrous (which makes sense, considering these claims come exclusively from people who have no experience with stock valuations and lots of experience trying to figure out what \"eew eew llams a evah I\" means).\n",

      "    Apes love sarcastically referring to their favorite company as a \"DyInG bRiCk AnD mOrTaR\" as a way to poke fun at those who don't realize that GameStop is moving toward e-commerce. But GameStop being a primarily brick and mortar company wasn't its main issue. Its main issue is that people have less and less need to buy physical games. Nowadays, people download games straight to their hard-drives. Buying a game online and having GameStop deliver it to you is definitely more convenient than having to go out and buy the game at a store, but it's still less convenient than simply downloading a digital game. And a third-party distributor like GameStop is nothing but an irrelevant middle man when it comes to digital games. It used to be the case that Microsoft (a company without many retail locations) needed to sell games to companies like GameStop, who would in turn sell those game to consumers. Now, though, Microsoft can sell to gamers directly. This is more efficient for publishers and consumers alike, so why would either group want to involve GameStop or any other third party?\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Whether online or at brick and mortar locations, GameStop's primary source of revenue has always been physical games, and the demand for physical games is continuing to plummet. That is by far GameStop's biggest obstacle to becoming profitable. Moreover, in 2022, transitioning to e-commerce isn't that bullish. In most cases, it's just the bare minimum necessary to keep afloat, and in GameStop's case, it might not even be that.\n",

      "\n",
      "    Publishers will never allow their games to be sold on a platform that allows players to resell them. Video game resale has always been terrible for publishers. If 3 people buy a game, publishers will want to claim the profits from all 3 sales. But imagine if 1 person buys the game, then sells it to his friend, and then that friend sells it to another friend. Now the game has been bought 3 times, but the publisher only benefits from the first sale rather than all 3. It's even worse if the company distributing the games (in this case, GameStop) can buy the game back and sell it to someone else. With this kind of system in place, hundreds of people could end up playing a game that the publisher has only sold once. Even if the publisher gets a cut of the resale profits, they would still be taking a huge hit. And publishers aren't the only ones who would take a hit...\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    Game distributors (like GameStop) would also take a hit from digital resale. Gamers selling used games to their friends hurts the bottom lines of publishers and distributors alike. It always has. With physical games, though, it at least made sense for GameStop to buy a copy of Halo from little Timmy rather than Microsoft if Timmy was willing to sell it at a lower price. But with digital games, supply never runs out. Distributors with the rights to a game effectively have an infinite supply. If GameStop already has an infinite supply of Halos from Microsoft, they have no need for Timmy's copy. Of what benefit would it be to have infinity plus one copies of Halo? This is likely why...\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    GameStop has made no announcements regarding digital game resale. This 4 part counterargument almost seems like a waste of time because, honestly, this is the only point I should need to make. Do you know what GameStop has done with NFTs? It hired an NFT team and launched the beta for an NFT marketplace. That's it. Many companies have NFT marketplaces and even more have NFT teams, so why should we blindly assume that every major innovation even tangentially related to NFTs will be spearheaded by GameStop? GameStop didn't invent NFTs; it doesn't have a patent on them. Even if digital resale or replacing the NYSE or creating a \"Ready Player One\" style Metaverse (all of which are things that many apes genuinely expect GameStop to do with NFTs, mind you) really were made possible with NFTs, why should we assume that GameStop will be the company to do these things?\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    If there are any apes reading this, please let me know why you expect with near certainty that GameStop will beat everyone to the punch with all of these massive innovations because, for the life of me, I can't figure out why anyone would think that. My best guess is that it basically revolves around GameStop being an established brand with existing infrastructure, a talented chairman, and over a billion dollars in cash.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I've already explained why some of those advantages aren't as important as apes think they are, but it should also be noted just how unpredictable companies can be. For example, if I told you 15 years ago that a single company would account for nearly 50% of all online sales, you would probably guess Target, Walmart, or eBay. You likely wouldn't guess Amazon (a company that basically only sold ebooks at the time). Yet here we are. Target, Walmart, and eBay had incredibly talented leaders, established brands, massive infrastructure in place, and they were still beaten by Amazon.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    And, as I'm sure you all know, Amazon is far from the only successful underdog in the American economy. Hell, if you're an ape, you already expect GameStop to be a successful underdog. You already believe that a company can go from a dying brick and mortar on the verge of collapse to a powerhouse overthrowing Amazon itself. The point is that no matter what advantages a company has, competitors are always plotting their next move, and some will come completely out of left field. Even if in a year we really are buying all of our games on an NFT marketplace, this marketplace could be started by Toys R Us, for all we know. It could be started by some random guy currently working in a garage. The idea that GameStop's few advantages guarantee its victory over all of its competitors (many of which have formidable advantages of their own) in every endeavor is just juvenile.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    In summary, a marketplace that allows the resale of digital games does not require NFTs. Even if NFTs did open the door for this kind of marketplace, publishers wouldn't allow their games to be sold on it. Even if some publishers did want to sell their games on it, digital resale would hurt GameStop. And even if GameStop wanted to do this (which they haven't indicated in the slightest), there's no reason to assume that they'd be able to do it ahead of their competitors.\n",

      "    I'm aware that apes have countless theories about how GameStop will do everything from selling mortgages to curing cancer with their NFT marketplace, and I can't possibly address all of these outlandish claims. But most of these theories are 1) theoretically possible without NFTs, 2) impossible because of other forces in the market, 3) not profitable for GameStop, and/or 4) not an innovation that we can blindly assume GameStop will spearhead.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Realistically, GameStop's NFT marketplace will probably be like the NFT marketplace that Ubisoft recently created. Maybe if you pre-order Call of Duty at GameStop, you'll get a golden P90 that's functionally identical to every other golden P90, but you'll get a link confirming that your golden P90 is the original golden P90. Activision might even allow you to sell this P90 to someone else (though, again, Activision can already allow this without NFTs). You'll likely also be able to buy \"original\" pieces of concept art or something, which isn't that great considering you can already do that on existing NFT marketplaces. NFT marketplaces are usually profitable, but GameStop may have trouble standing out from the crowd, and they're sure as hell not going to do so with used digital games. \n",
      "  \n",
      "    The NFT marketplace raises the fundamental value of GameStop, but only by a small amount. This might have been different if GameStop wasn't so late to the party or if it had a clear way to distinguish its marketplace from other NFT marketplaces, but that's simply not the case at this time, nor is there any indication that it will be the case in the foreseeable future. Don't expect this marketplace to cause some massive revolution.\n",

      "    But even if demand for physical video games is dropping and GameStop isn't able to sell digital video games with or without NFTs, surely we should be bullish about how quickly they're expanding into new markets, right? If you've been on any GME-related sub recently, you've no doubt seen apes cheering about how PC parts, plush toys, and board games are now being offered at their local GameStops. In reality, though, this isn't so much of an expansion as it is a desperate attempt to stay afloat as GameStop becomes increasingly unable to sell video games, physical or otherwise. A pizzeria expanding their menu to include burgers, hot dogs, and salads may seem bullish, but only until you realize that they're only doing so because no one wants their pizzas anymore.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    I admire GameStop's willingness to try new things, but at the end of the day, chess sets and graphics cards just don't sell nearly as well as video games. And this is reflected in GameStop's consistently poor earnings and its inability to sell so much of its holiday inventory. The expansion into these new markets is more bullish than simply throwing in the towel would have been, but it's ultimately indicative of something very bearish.\n",

      "    To summarize, GameStop was (if we're being generous) worth $20/share in January 2021. Since then, a few mildly bullish things have happened, which have been largely offset by the many bearish things that have happened. If you wanted to buy GameStop right now at $20 for its fundamentals, it may be a reasonable investment, but at $150+, it's almost certainly not. Of course, that's not to say the company can't succeed. Ryan Cohen might be able to turn the company around and bring its fundamental value to $30/share. Maybe he'll be incredible and bring its value to $60/share. If he's able to triple the company's fundamental value in his first year as chairman, that will be amazing, and as unlikely as it may be, it is somewhat possible. But if you're buying in at $150 thinking that the value will easily increase fifty-fold, without a short squeeze, simply because Ryan Cohen has cash, an NFT team, and some Pokémon cards, you may be disappointed.\n",

But guess what, the following day was precisely the end of the lock-up period and insiders could start selling their shares (check by yourself: IPO prospectus page 200 at bottom)... Coincidence? Well I personally don't think so, market makers know very well this kind of information and given the important change in the float following the end of the lock-up (from 60m to 375m shares as shown in the following graph), I wouldn't be surprised if they kept lowering the price in order to buy shares from insiders at a wholesale price (in the end the market maker is indeed a wholesaler...)\n",

Indeed, 75% of the call contracts expiring in June are tied to strikes above or equal to $12.5 and 44% to options with strikes between $12.5 and $15. In fact, if WISH price closes above $15 today, more than the equivalent of 5.1% of float will be in the money, from which 3.1% for strikes $12.5 to $15 alone.\n",

It was due to extremely high expectation, lowered Q3 revenue forecast, and big run up before the earning. And it happened to Wayfair. The same pattern also applies to ETSY. If you bought ETSY PUTs before earning and sold right after it opened, it's a two bagger.\n",

      "    At this point, you probably become really confident that same pattern is going to apply to EBAY. Online e-commerce, great growth in Q1, stock price close to ATH, and likely will have lowered Q3 guidance. You are right, absolutely right and EBAY actually did much worse than AMZN, ETSY, and W. It not only has soft Q3 guidance but also missed revenue and the active buyers dropped by 2%. However, the stock price did not drop more than 2% after the call and today at close, it actually closed green. At the end, IV fuked both calls and puts.\n",

      "    Domestic profitability will increase over the following quarter. Surcharges are coming! $1 for ground and $2 for air at least. Reports for up to $4-$5 surcharges for peak shipping starting November going into January. These increases bode well for a shift to increase domestic profitability and align well with an important season.\n",

It’s partnership within Operation Warp Speed is bullish. Did you see what that money did to all vaccine stocks?\n",
      "  \n",
      "    UPS is in a unique position as it benefitted from COVID’s initial chaos, has continued to benefit throughout due to the e-commerce shift and strong Asian demand, and will continue to benefit from the holiday season and vaccine distribution. If you need more proof look at various retail players who benefitted off the e-commerce and Asian demand shift such as Nike. Nike showed decline nationally but gained in the Chinese market. Most importantly, Nike showed an 82% increase in Online sales.\n",

Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay & Paypal)\n",

      "Title: Shopify is not a profitable business model, DD inside : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Tuesday, April 03, 2018\n",
      "Content: Shopify has consistently grown their operating deficit YoY. In 2014, operating loss was -22M on 105M of revenue. In 2017, they have an operating loss -49M on 673M of revenue; -35M net income. Is operational profitability in sight? No, 2018 expectations guide a GAAP loss of -100M on 980M of revenue. In 2014, 105M of revenue out of GMV of 3.7B is 2.79%; this is a rate to look at profitability of the Shopify platform. Being a new company, I'd say those are good numbers. We can look at Etsy which has a much better platform profitability. Esty's 2017 GMV is 3.2B, and they made 441M of revenue on that volume which is a rate of 13.56%. Shopify's numbers in 2014 are much earlier in their business, so maybe they don't fully reflect the profitability possibilities of the platform. However, 2017 doesn't get much better. Shopify's 2017 GMV totaled 26.3B. How much did they make on the volume? 673M. That's 2.56%, even worse than three years ago. Revenue/GMV gradually declines, Ebay's was 18% just five years ago and sits around 10% today. This is fine, but making only 2.56% on a platform that just opened is dismal. Ebay makes 9.7% on 84B of GMV today. They are different platforms to Shopify, but it still doesn't excuse Shopify's lack of profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "    While Shopify prides itself on organic growth, they spent 226M on Sales and Marketing, which is 34% of their revenue, to bring more users on their platform. How the hell are they reporting positive EPS? Great question.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    They have funded their entire business through dilution and sale of stock. It's a staggering amount of cash flow they are burning through to attempt to achieve profitability. Proceeds from their most recent stock sale totaled 560M. They go and spend these proceeds on marketable securities. I calculated this by doing the math of the cash flow. If you add the proceeds of sale of stock from 2017 and the gains from maturity of marketable securities, (560M + 642M), you get 1,200M in positive cash flow. They spent 1,129M on marketable securities this year. Lets do the math from 2016: (224M + 140M) = 364M, marketable securities purchased in 2016 was 369M. While yes this is smart, it's creating the illusion of a profitable business model. Additionally, they are paying their employees in stock. This is where it gets interesting.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    On Yahoo Finance, Shopify's TTM EPS is +0.15. That's a Non-GAAP number though. Their true earnings are -0.42 for their EPS, which includes employee expense. The expense of paying employees in stock is allowed to be subtracted from earnings through a non-gaap measure, and this is what they report. Quote from most recent quarterly report, Q417, on 2018 outlook to explain this: \"GAAP operating loss in the range of $95 million to $105 million. Adjusted operating income4 in the range of $(5) million to $5 million, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes of $100 million\" If you check their Q4 reports, you can see the changes to GAAP measures. They added +0.51 EPS for stock based compensation and +0.06 EPS for payroll taxes related to stock based compensation. Obviously, paying employees is an expense, but they get ommit it from their earnings per share by reporting in non-gaap measures. Pretty crazy.\n",

      "    Atleast they don't have debt right? Well, the investors paying for their stock are paying for more operational losses, with no profitability in sight. Even if SHOPs GMV skyrockets to 100B, they would only be producing maybe 2.5B in revenue. Even then, operating expenses have always exceeded gross profit historically for SHOP. With no sign of operational expense slowing down, great revenue growth numbers won't do much for them. Eventually, I see sentiment turning around as operating losses grow and investors arn't seeing a return. Maybe 2018 will be better? Nope.\n",

      "  \n",
      "    Then you take the game and sell it for 50€ on Ebay because you think the price for the game will decrease over time because Fifa is a game which will be bought less over Time because there will (or maybe already is) a better game (Fifa2022) soon. You now have 100€ on your bank account. After 2½ Months you buy the game back for 30€ You now have 70€ on your bank account. You made 20€ Profit.\n",

      "    Suddenly a lot of people start buying the game. Maybe something makes the games special (maybe a printing mistake on the cover) or some random people in the internet say: lets buy every existing FIFA2021 game. The price for the game starts rising. 60€ 80€ 95€ You see that and think: Shit I have to buy the game now otherwise it may be possible that I can't give back the game in 3 Months I only have 100€. So you buy the game for 95€ in order to be able to give back the game. Because you just bought the game the Price increases to 100€ which causes that the next dude who sold the game of his friend has to buy the game. The price will increase till everyone who sold a game which he doesn't own bought one back.\n",

Or that’s the plan. But smoothbrained apes keep buying all the copies you borrowed so now instead of owing 1 copy you owe hundreds and the price is still going up.\n",

      "    Here's my only question I have yet to see posed or answered anywhere. Every single explanation of short selling, especially in instances of over 100% of the float being shorted, has a line that says the short sellers MUST buy the shares back, regardless of the price. I understand the nature of the contracts and the math involved. I get it, I really do. But my only question is...so what?\n",

This is definitely comparing apples to oranges, but when Epstein was finally wrangled up, it seemed like the entire world knew he was guilty, and justice HAD to be dealt. And then look what happened.\n",

      "    Day after day we see the people in power pull out all the stops to try and get people to fall off the wagon, but at the end of the day, what if they don't cover? Nothing came of the 2008 market crash. Why would this be any different? I realize this is probably the most negative sentiment associated with this trip so far but I really would like to understand this perspective better. Like, if they decide not to purchase the shares back then what - the hedge funds who shorted it just get liquidated? They lose their jobs and pick up at another firm? What is the end result in this hypothetical?\n",

      "    All the steps are in place for a turnover within a year. This is ridiculously undervalued. Top that with a ceo replacement and 243 jobs posting within a month, I would say things are moving in place and someone has a clear plan with this company. You dont hire so much people if you are not planning on growing 🧐. Why is the replacement of the CEO important, because it means changes are coming :   “if you believe that your company is planning to merge, or has secretly already agreed to merge, and the announcement might not be for several months, then the resignation of key employees can be seen as bullish.”  To me is very strange to see $WISH CEO steps down so easily, he seems someone that would fight until the end and we saw that on the past.. For that reason I think that we would have a buyout coming.. So let’s put pieces together. Wish has been posting a lot of executives positions on linked recently. A lot of the management team comes from tech and google. Now the new cfo Vivian managed buyout for two previous companies. Seems like wish will follow the track of a potentail buyout opportunity or a great future growth.\n",

      "    Snap, Jumia, GME and AMC had/has way bigger issues than Wish recently and look at where they are now (they all increased several thousand %). Wish has a lot of resources and competent leadership to turn the situation around. Wish also has quite a strong balance sheet, and is virtually debt free with marketable securities, cash, and cash equivalents of approximately $1+ billion. I believe Wish is undervalued and it will be a multiple bagger in 2022 or 2023.\n",

      "    If you try to do a backtest on the biggest monopolies of today, you would quickly run into hindsight bias. The companies that are monopolies now might or might not have been monopolies a decade back. For example, there was no way of knowing Google would dominate the in-app ecosystem in Phones, and that Amazon would be the king of cloud services back in 2010.\n",

      "    a. Investing in industries with rising concentration as the market seems slow to recognize their increased prizing power\n",

      "    So the next time you’re considering a stock for long-term investment, add this layer to your analysis: Does the company have prospects of growing into a monopoly or dominant player in a market with just a few players, or is it a lucrative market where competitors can eat away the profits? The first is what you should bet on.\n",

      "Content: The value proposition with selling and buying used games was not there for me.  It always felt lopsided.  Gamestop will pay you let’s say $3 dollars for a game, then turn around and sell it for $30.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    You could argue that Gamestop’s cost of managing inventory justifies the markup.  This did not change anything for me as a customer.  I turned to eBay instead.  I felt I got a truer market value with my exchanges.  Now even though I always bought and never sold on eBay a seller gets the most profits, not eBay.  An individual seller benefiting the most.  Power to the players Gamestop, don’t forget!\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Hopefully the buyer got a truer market value as well instead of a set price that probably doesn’t sell until it goes on sale or worse clearance.  Potentially wasting resources required by Gamestop to manage the inventory and floor space.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    If Gamestop could eliminate this obstacle, now that I’m diamond FUCKING hands, I could see myself using Gamestop for my used video game exchanges.  Even selling this time.  I could see how Gamestop could use it’s store fronts and name recognition (ape t-shirts anyone??) to leverage itself as the premier destination for the used gaming market to even rival eBay.  Well it fucking better or I’m never getting my tendies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    Now onto the stuff I absolutely loved about Gamestop as a customer.  Midnight motherfucking launches.  Battlefield 3, Destiny, The Order 1886.  I think it was just those three but I had a blast.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    You can argue it’s all digital now so the days of actually having to go to the store is done but at the moment, the used market is limited to physical.  Some folks also just prefer physical media.  I know I feel this way about books.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    And that’s it unfortunately.  I still love gaming, since the Atari 2600.  I just now purchase digitally so I don’t have to worry about the literal baggage but I think physical media will always have a place.  I still have my N64 and Dreamcast.  Maybe if the conditions are right, I’d even let go of my beloved Dreamcast collection in very good used condition with four controllers fishing rod arcade stick and two official light guns.  Gamestop DM me if you’re serious about paying me market value for them!  Sike, I’m holding.\n",

      "  \n",
      "Last Week’s Mid-week multi-bagger: began pumping OPEC+ & XOM RAMBO in the updates mid-week.  That flow was correct, and boy oh boy was oil a gusher. XOM COP etc printed.\n",

      "  \n",
      "Key Lesson Learned 1: In volatile times when the trend is against the sector, we want to stick with RAMBO and UOA that is company-specific (Investor/Analyst Day) rather than chasing conferences and meetings.  If tech is dumping its brains out, for example, the CFO of CRM giving a speech at a random conference has the efficacy of tears in the rain.  Very tough but very useful lesson, and sorry to those who got completely rinsed on those lesser tech RAMBOs.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Key Lesson Learned 2: When it comes to sectors, the trend is your friend.  The news predictions coming out regarding OPEC+ were doomsday, but I kept seeing large bets placed on oil giants from Monday to Wednesday.  I decided to trust where the money was going, not what the news was predicting.  This, coupled with my basic research knowledge from last month that the Saudi’s have truly embraced the pump, was enough to zig when the news zagged.  There are a million reasons why news leaks could lead you to go one way, but around here we ALWAYS watch where the money, not where the manipulated headlines go.\n",

To be critical, there are growing pains in this model as Wish becomes dependent on a hyper localized merchant base that is turning into the “face” of the company\n",

      "Title: GME Valuation to Help You Sleep : r/wallstreetbets\n",
      "Date: Tuesday, January 26, 2021\n",
      "Content: Alright fellow tards and autists, rest your eyes on the attached valuation and hold steady in your conviction that WE LIKE THE STOCK.  While GameStop doesn't have true market comparable peers, it is a traditionally a brick & mortar store that Ryan Cohen is looking to move more online (per his letter to the board).  This is a strategy taken by other B&M stores such as BBY (Best Buy, not your mom's soap company), TGT, and WMT.  I threw AMZN into the mix for shits and giggles, but it is really a different beast.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    While these stores do more than just gaming based hardware and software, there isn't a single segment in the retail space to my knowledge that is growing as rapidly.  On a gross profit basis, GME actually outperforms the bulk of this peer group, (meaning the margin on the products they are selling have a higher profit margin, for you real tards).  Where it lags is in operating expense.  This can be mitigated in a couple ways: 1) closing less profitable stores (already being undertaken), and 2) transition sales to online.  While this may impact COGS, it will also improve OpEX as a % of total revenue.  I have put together a valuation showing GME projected pricing based on their paltry TTM revenue figures based on the peer group as well as on Operating Income if they were able to improve this figure as described above.  As mentioned, AMZN is an outlier, so I ran it with and without AMZN in the comps.  Based on all of the media attention (read: free advertising) GME has gotten through this craze, I believe revenue will improve going forward on that alone.  This has not been baked into this model.\n",
      "  \n",
      "    There is nothing in these prices related to any sort of short position either, just straight up valuation using the metrics listed in the spreadsheet.\n",
